# Student Grades

This is simple project to develop an Student Grading application. This project guided from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-print-student-grades)

## Project Overview

### The parameter for the application are:
* You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades
* Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
* Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
* Your application need to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
* Your Application needs to output/display each student's name and final score.

### Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows:

* Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100

* Nicolas: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85

* Zahirah:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79

* Jeong:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97

### The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:

Student | Grade
--- | ---
Sophia | 94.6  A
Nicolas | 83.6  B
Zahirah | 83.4  B
Jeong | 95.4  A
